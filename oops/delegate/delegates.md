delegates
1).delegate are just like function pointers in c and c#
2).delegate can hold one or more function referances
3).when a delegate hold more then one function referances.then It is called multicast.
4).when a multicast delegate is invoked all the functions in the delegate will be invoked in the queue pattern
5).if all the functions in a multicast delegate returns value than only last function return value is available 
6).all the delegate are finally converted into classes by the compiler
7).all the functions in a delegate should macth with the deligate signate delegate signature and function signature should be same
